# cnn_model_architecture
This model is designed basically for identification of amount of salt and pepper noise present in an image using deep_cnn.

About Data Set.

In this data-set train, test, valid folder each having eleven classes.
If folder end with 0.01 means the folder are having the images of 1% of salt
and pepper noise in the similar fashion 0.02,0.03,...... so on.


If you will use the noise data set available in the repository kindly cite the paper related to MSRA data set. Cite the following paper
